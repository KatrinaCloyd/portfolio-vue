    <article className="blurb">
      <p>
        In high school I thought I would grow up to be an art teacher or a poet,
        or ideally both.
      </p>
      <p>
        In college, for a short while, I thought I would be an artist, but I
        went back to the art teacher plan. After college, with my Ohio teaching
        license in hand, I thought I would never become an art teacherâ€¦
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I became an Oregonian. I began painting, baking, jewelry making,
        street fair vending, gardening, freelancing, and pretty much trying it
        all. I needed a creative outlet and a combination avenues led me to
        design.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I became a Graphic Designer. Years of that corporate life taught me
        so much but I still wanted more. I wanted a challenge, more variance in
        the day to day... <br />And I wanted to know how to build my own site!
      </p>
      <p>
        So I became a Software Engineer.
        <br />
        And I finally feel like I have found my place. Now I get to problem
        solve with new challenges every day. I get to be creative in my
        solutions and thinking. I get to continually learn new things. And I get
        to make things beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still love to bake, hike, garden, occasionally find time to paint,
        make awesome family themed halloween costumes, and try as often as
        possible to explore what the world has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe someday I will still become a poet.</p>
